# Insightbot
Insightbot is a RAG chatbot built with LangChain, supporting OpenAI, Google Generative AI, and Hugging Face APIs. Upload documents (txt, pdf, CSV, docx) and chat with your data. Insightbot retrieves relevant content and augments LLM responses for accurate, up-to-date answers, all via an intuitive Streamlit UI

Project Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for generating creative and insightful content, but since they are trained on static datasets, their responses can sometimes be outdated or inaccurate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this limitation by connecting LLMs to external data sources, enabling more accurate and up-to-date answers.

Insightbot is a RAG chatbot built using LangChain. It supports OpenAI, Google Generative AI, and Hugging Face APIs. Users can upload documents in .txt, .pdf, .csv, or .docx formats and interactively chat with their data. The system retrieves relevant documents and sends them to the selected LLM, ensuring that responses are grounded in your specific content.

Throughout this project, every component of the RAG pipeline is exploredâ€”from document ingestion to the conversational retrieval chain. The user interface is developed using Streamlit for an intuitive chat experience.
